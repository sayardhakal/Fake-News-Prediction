# Fake-News-Prediction
In this project, I am building a Fake News Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python. I will be using Logistic Regression model for prediction. The dataset used in this project is taken from the kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data?select=train.csv). The dataset contains 5 column i.e. id,title, author, text and label. I have combine both author and title column as a "contant" column and used it for prediction. The label column contain binary value 0 and 1 i.e., 0--> Real News and 1--> Fake News. Overall process of this project are given below:
1. Text data collection
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Train test split
4. Model training
5. Evaluation of model
6. Building a predictive system.
